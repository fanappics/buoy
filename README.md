Accessible Vue.js UI library

## Goals

The goal of the Buoy project is to create a beautiful, functional UI library for Vue.js that makes it easy for developers to follow the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag).

https://pattern-library.dequelabs.com is a resource for an accessible UI library we can use for an example of accessibility techniques.
